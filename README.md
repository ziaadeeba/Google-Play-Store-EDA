The purpose of this project was to gather and analyze detailed information on apps in the Google Play Store in order to provide insights
on app features and the current state of the Android app market.
As part of this project, I analyzed a large dataset of apps from the Play Store and used Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform various data cleaning, transformation, and visualization tasks. I explored different aspects of the app market, such as categories, ratings, reviews, and installs, and gained valuable insights into what makes a successful app.
