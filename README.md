# **Google Play Store EDA**

This repository contains the code and data used to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Google Play Store. The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the characteristics of apps that are successful on the Google Play Store.

# ***Data***
The data used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle. It consists of information about approximately 10,000 Android apps that were available on the Google Play Store in 2018.

# ***Analysis***
The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python 3. The notebook contains the following sections:

# ***Data Cleaning and Preparation*** :
In this section, the raw data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This includes handling missing data, removing duplicates, and converting data types as needed.

# ***Data Exploration:*** 
In this section, we explore the data to gain insights into the characteristics of the apps available on the Google Play Store. We examine the distribution of app categories, app ratings, app sizes, and more.

# ***Data Visualization:***
In this section, we use various visualizations to help us better understand the data. This includes bar charts,pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

# ***Usage***
To reproduce the analysis, you will need to have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Once you have these packages installed, you can run the analysis by opening the google_play_store_eda.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and running all cells.
